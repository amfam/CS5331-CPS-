# CS5331-CPS-

**GitHub repo description for Arduino CPS projects**

This repository contains the code for a variety of Arduino CPS projects, including:

* Traffic management
* Sonar
* RFID sensor
* Car blind spot monitor
* Gesture controlled car
* IR remote controlled car

These projects are designed to demonstrate the use of Arduino to develop and implement CPS (cyber-physical systems). CPS are systems that integrate physical and computational components to monitor and control the physical world.

The traffic management project uses a variety of sensors to detect the presence of vehicles and pedestrians. The Arduino then uses this information to control the traffic flow using traffic lights and other devices.

The sonar project uses a sonar sensor to measure the distance to objects. The Arduino then uses this information to display the distance to the user or to control other devices, such as a robot or a blind spot monitor.

The RFID sensor project uses an RFID sensor to identify objects. The Arduino then uses this information to perform various tasks, such as controlling access to a secure area or tracking the movement of objects.

The car blind spot monitor project uses a variety of sensors to detect the presence of vehicles in the driver's blind spot. The Arduino then uses this information to warn the driver of the presence of other vehicles.

The gesture controlled car project uses a variety of sensors to detect the gestures of the user. The Arduino then uses this information to control the movement of the car.

The IR remote controlled car project uses an IR receiver to receive commands from an IR remote control. The Arduino then uses these commands to control the movement of the car.

These projects are all open source, so you can use them as a starting point for your own CPS projects. You can also contribute to the repository by adding your own projects or by improving existing projects.



## Conclusion

By including the above features in your GitHub repository, you can make it easier for others to use your code and learn about CPS development.
